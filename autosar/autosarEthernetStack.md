Lest understand the **Autosar Ethernet stack** in this blog. So the first question that comes to our mind is “why is the need for Ethernet in the automotive industry increasing rapidly in this decade?” but don’t worry about this. In this blog we are gonna clear all your doubts and explain each module of Ethernet stack. So let’s get started!!

## **Why Ethernet in Automotive?**

To understand this, let’s go back to the last few decades of the automotive industry revolution. 10 year ago most of the “ECU” were present in cars such as Power window, Airbag, Throttle control, lightning control, etc… need low bandwidth for communication and by using CAN communication protocol it can be done. However now in recent time rapidly increase number of ECU in car and need more bandwidth to transmit and compute huge data to perform task like autonomous driving , Automatic car parking, Connected car, and many more. It pushed automotive manufacturers to go for another best option for vehicle communication. And we already have “Ethernet” since a long time back and it is the de-facto standard for consumer industry. And by performing small changes it can be possible to adopt it in the automotive industry. Hence entry of Ethernet in the Automotive world happened and it will be revolutionary in the coming future.
